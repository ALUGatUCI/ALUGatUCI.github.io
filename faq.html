        <td>
          We’re a student-run organization for anyone interested in Linux,
          open-source software, system administration, or simply learning more
          about how computers work behind the scenes. We’re starting small,
          focusing on building a friendly, hands-on community.

      <tr>
        <td>Do I need to use Linux to join?</td>
        <td>
          Not at all. If you’re curious about Linux, want to install it for the
          first time, or just want to see what it’s about, you’re welcome here.

            <li>Introductory Linux tutorials</li>
            <li>Hands-on projects</li>
            <li>Sharing tips, dotfiles, and desktop ricing setups</li>

      <tr>
        <td>Do I need to bring anything to meetings?</td>
        <td>
          If possible, bring your laptop. If required, we’ll provide hardware,
          but bringing your laptop to SSH or write scripts will be useful.

        <td>How do I stay updated?</td>
        <td>
          We provide a Discord server, which can be found

          you’re using it for the first time or already daily-driving Arch.

      <tr>
        <td>Why does this website have a retro design?</td>
        <td>
          Because Linux is a retro operating system that pairs best with a retro website. Also, our CSS skills are stuck in 1999.
        </td>
        <td>
          Web development isn't the métier of the maintainer, Chris, but most importantly,
          we believe it best identifies with who we are as a group stylistically speaking.

          Can I bring a Windows or Mac device to meetings?

          Get your filthy proprietary software out of here and never come back until you convert!

          Can I come just for the vibes?

          No, you must be a hardcore Arch daily-driver to even be allowed here.

          Everyone is welcome to come for any reason! Even if you're just curious, feel free to come!

          There's no "best" distro. We can say there is a distro for everyone though!

        <td>
          Is this a cult?
        </td>

          Yes, we require you to never touch a proprietary operating system ever again and
          have a blind faith in Linux!
        </td>
        <td>
          No, we're just a group of students passionate about Linux and open-source. Everyone is welcome, and participation is always voluntary.
